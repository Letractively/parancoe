                aiming to simplify the release of web applications
                promoting the convention over configuration philosophy and the

            <p>Parancoe purpose is to give to developers a set of libraries ready
                to build standard web applications (which in most cases are just crud
                applications) without worrying of long and harmful configurations files.
                Parancoe will be composed of a full MVC stack.
